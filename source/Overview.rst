Overview
==================================
   
   CRHM-WQ is an extended version of CRHM (Cold Regions Hydrological Model) that includes water quality modules. CRHM is an hydrological modelling platform developed at the University of Saskatchewan that is unique in its ability to simulate cold regions processes (e.g., frozen soils, blowing snow). It has been developed specifically for Canada, it is supported by a large team of scientists, and it is under continuous development. CRHM-WQ allows the simulation of nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P). The new models simulate hydrological transport and biogeochemical cycling. The tool has been tested and validated in the South Tobacco Creek Watershed, Manitoba.
